    <!--there are two types of element in html , 1- inline elements 2- block elements-->
    <!--inline elements are fixing the content within the flow of text, they do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include <span>, <a>, and <img>.-->

    <!--block elements are used to create larger sections of content, they start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples include <div>, <h1> to <h6>, and <p>.-->
